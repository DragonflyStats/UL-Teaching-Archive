\section{The \texttt{train} Function}
One of the primary tools in the package is the train function which can be used to

\begin{itemize}
\item evaluate, using resampling, the eﬀect of model tuning parameters on performance
\item choose the “optimal” model across these parameters
\item estimate model performance from a training set
\end{itemize}
