I'm running a random forest model using R's caret package, and running varImp on the returned object gives me the averaged variable importance across the number of bootstrap iterations. However, I would rather assess variable importance for each iteration. Is this possible using the caret package?

Reproducible example:
\begin{verbatim}
library(caret)
mod <- train(Species ~ ., data = iris,
         method = "cforest",
         controls = cforest_unbiased(ntree = 10))
varImp(mod)
\end{verbatim}
returns:
\begin{verbatim}
cforest variable importance
Overall
Petal.Width  100.0000
Petal.Length  86.6279
Sepal.Length   0.5814
Sepal.Width    0.0000 
\end{verbatim}
what I'm interested in is rather a list of length=number of bootstrap resamples with variable importance for each iteration. This might be possible using some combination of returnResamp = "all" and a custom summaryFunction but I'm not wise enough to know.
