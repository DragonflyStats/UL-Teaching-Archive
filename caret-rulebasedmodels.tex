% Rule Based Models

\section{Rule–Based Models}
if-then statements generated by a tree deﬁne a unique route to one
terminal node for any sample.
A rule is a set of if-then conditions that have been collapsed into
independent conditions.
For the example:
\begin{verbatim}
if X1 >= 1.7 and X2 >= 202.1 then Class = 1
if X1 >= 1.7 and X2 < 202.1 then Class = 1
if X1 < 1.7 then Class = 2
\end{verbatim}
